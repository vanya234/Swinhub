        <h2>Swinburne Residences</h2>
          <p>Whether you're a college freshman, or have no idea at all deciding where you will be staying, consider choosing the on-campus options provided by Swinburne.</p>
          <p>Living on-campus is the easiest and most convenient solution as it takes only around 2 minutes for you to walk from your place to the lecture halls. Besides, there are many facilities that are provided to you without additional costs.
            Futhermore, Swinburne Residences hosts social Groups frequently. This means you get to know and make friends from various backgrounds while having fun together. 
          </p>
          <p>You can choose to live on your own, or you can share with others with a maximum of 4 persons. While this may not be the most budget-friendly solution, at least you get to save yourself from headaches when deciding where to live.</p>

        <h2>Living off-campus</h2>
          <p>Want more freedom and control over what you prefer? If you have friends that are interested in living under the same roof, or perhaps you're just having a tight budget, renting off-campus is always an ideal option.</p>
          <p>There are lots of resources where you can look for a place of your choice.</p>
