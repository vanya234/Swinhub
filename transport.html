        <h1>Public Transport</h1><hr>

        <h2>Trams</h2>
          <p>Trams are a major form of public transport in Melbourne. The tram network is extensive and it is ideal as a means to travel within the center of the city.</p>
          <p>You can travel without cost in the free tram zone that spans between the CBD and Docklands.</p>

        <h2>Trains</h2>
          <p>You can reach further destinations via trains. Most trains operate between the City and a suburban destination via the City Loop, which is a four-track, five station loop that encircles downtown.</p>
          <p>As a general rule, trains operate from Flinders Street station to and from their suburban destination via the City loop stations of Southern Cross, Flagstaff, Melbourne Central and Parliament.</p>

        <h2>Buses</h2>
          <p>There are more routes for buses than trams. They travel further out into the suburbs, and across the city more directly than other public transport options. 
            Moreover, buses run frequently to major hubs, including shopping centres, schools, hospitals, leisure and sports venues, and some of Melbourne's biggest attractions.</p> 
          <p>Just remember to tap your Myki both on and off when using buses.</p>
